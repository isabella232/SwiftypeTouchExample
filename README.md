# SwiftypeTouch Example App

This example app shows how easy it is to get started with [SwiftypeTouch](https://github.com/swiftype/SwiftypeTouch) to add [Swiftype-powered search](http://swiftype.com) to your iOS application.

To run the sample application:

1. Check out the code.
2. Check out the SwiftypeTouch git submodule.

        git submodule init
        git submodule update

3. Edit the `Settings.plist` to add your crawler-based engine key (you can find this on your Swiftype dashboard). 
4. Click the Run button to launch the app. You'll be able to search right away.

Don't have a crawler-based engine? Go to [swiftype.com](http://swiftype.com), sign up if you haven't yet, and create a new engine with the site you want to crawl. 
Once the crawl is finished, you'll be able to use the sample app.
